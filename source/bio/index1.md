## About

Greatings! My name is Lang Liu.

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Illinois Institute of Technology. My advisor is Dr. [Farzaneh Derakhshan](http://gauss.cs.iit.edu/~fderakhshan/). My research interests are in formal methods and using the technique to ensure the safety and security of concurrent programs. 

Currently, I am working on LabelBI, a logic system based on the logic of Bunched Implication that enables compositional reasoning about underapproximations.
